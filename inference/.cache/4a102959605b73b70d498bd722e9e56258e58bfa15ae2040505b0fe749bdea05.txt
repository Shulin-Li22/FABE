# Duplicate logic that should be refactored

def compute_discount(amount, vip):
    if vip:
        if amount > 100:
            return amount * 0.8
        else:
            return amount * 0.9
    else:
        if amount > 100:
            return amount * 0.95
        else:
            return amount


### Response:
def compute_discount(amount, vip):
    if vip:
        return apply_discount_if_gt(amount, 100, 0.8)
    else:
        return apply_discount_if_gt(amount, 100, 0.95)

def apply_discount_if_gt(amount, threshold, discount):
    return amount * (1 - discount) if amount > threshold else amount

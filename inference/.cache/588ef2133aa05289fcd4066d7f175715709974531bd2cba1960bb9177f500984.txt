Instruction:
You are a helpful senior Python engineer. 
Goal: improve readability.
Language: python.

Rules:
- Output ONLY the final code, no explanations.
- Keep functionality unchanged unless obviously dead code.
- Use clear naming and add minimal comments if essential.

Transform the following code accordingly.

Code:
# Dead code and unreachable branch

def foo(x):
    return x * 2
    y = x + 1  # unreachable
    if False:
        return y


### Response:
def foo(x):
    result = x * 2
    return result

# The code below is unreachable because the return statement in the function already returns the result of x * 2.
# So, the code below is dead code.
# y = x + 1
# if False:
#     return y
